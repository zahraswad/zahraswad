Hey there! I'm a Project Manager with hands-on experience in data analytics. I love working with dataâ€”collecting, organizing, and analyzing it to help businesses make smarter decisions. Iâ€™m skilled in Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and I have a strong grasp of key data techniques like dashboard building, report writing, data mining, and statistical analysis.

In this portfolio, youâ€™ll find a mix of projects that showcase my skills. Iâ€™ve included dashboards and reports Iâ€™ve built using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, designed to present data in a clear and visually engaging wayâ€”so decision-makers can easily grasp insights and take action.

Youâ€™ll also see some of my work with Python, SQL, and R, where I dive into large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and merge data from multiple sources to create a full picture.

Beyond the technical side, I bring strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. With a background in Mechanical Engineering and experience in the manufacturing industry, I know how to approach data analysis strategically and spot key patterns and opportunities.

Iâ€™m excited to share my work with you, and Iâ€™d love the chance to discuss my experience further. Feel free to reach out!

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
